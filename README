Note: This is just the /custom/Asterisk Module folder so far...

I need to commit the manifest, module install scripts, Administration, etc. 
Hopefully moving folders will not present too much of a challenge.

Developing modules for SugarCRM is kind of annoying from a versioning perspective since you got files all over the place...
